            I like all kinds of fruit, but when it comes to citrus, clementines are well , yes-my darlings . These diminutive fruits have a thin skin that peels off easily, making them ideal for a quick mid-afternoon snack. I love their juicy, sweet flesh, which is just a little more acidic than that of oranges, and their wonderful floral scent.
            By most accounts, clementines are the result of a cross between a mandarin and an orange that occurred at the beginning of the 20th century in the Algerian garden of a French missionary, Clement Rodier. Virtually unknown in this country 25 years ago, clementines are now the most popular mandarin-type citrus on the market. Much of the world production is concentrated in Spain and Morocco ( South Africa and Israel are also big producers ), but more and more citrus farms in California are being converted from oranges to clementines. Most of the clementines available in the United States are rather small, but larger
            varieties exist.

            Although snacking on ripe c1ementines dripping with juice is one of the best things winter can offer, this fruit is wonderful in recipes, too. AI; with other citrus, the flesh, the juice, and the zest can all contribute their delicious perfumed flavor to a dish. I use the zest and juice in sauces for meat or fish and in braises. Or I use them to make refreshing clementine sorbets or granitas (see the recipe at right) . A little zest gives a tantalizing flavor to vinaigrettes , homemade garlic mayonnaise, and marinades for meat, and it adds zing to a boring bowl of supermarket olives. Sectioned or sliced clementines are a fresh addition to winter salads. They are also lovely poached, used as a tart topping, or in a compote with other fruit.

                You'll find clementines from October through February. Choose fruits that are intact and firm, heavy for their size, and deeply colored. But don't avoid fruits that have a slight green cast-they'll color quickly. Stored at room temperature with good air circulation, clementines keep several days to a week. Turning them and, even more important, keeping a little space between fruits, helps prevent mold from setting in. For longer keeping, stash them in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator.
